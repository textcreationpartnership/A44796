who was an ey-witness unto
these things.

#####Body#####
The work of the Lord declared,
which was in the beginning,
when the word was with God,
and was the F
    _ The work of the Lord declared,
which was in the beginning,
when the word was with God,
and was the Fathers delight,
and man made in the Image of
God, and lived in the Lambs
Power, and he was mans life,
and this was before the transgression
of these declared, as
God hath manifested them by
his Spirit.

    _ Here the wise may learn, and they that
have a good understanding may
read the wisdome of God in a
Mystery, and also see the darke sottish
doctrine of the blind Apostates,
who have lost the power, and are keeping
people ignorant of the Mystery of
God.

    _ How peace, joy and delight possessed
every thing that God had made, every
thing which he had formed glorified
God their maker with one consent, in
the beginning, before the world was
framed, that lay in wickednesse.

    _ How man lost his state and dominion
and unity with God and all the creatures,
and how the Lambe came to
be slain, and the world that lies in
wickedness came to be formed, and
founded, and how the curse came, and
the wo upon the Serpent, which was
blessed before, and upon man and woman,
and the ground that received the
temptation, which was blessed before,
in the motion of the Power, came to
be cursed and how endles misery came
in upon all, in the transgression, declared
to them who have a good understanding.

    _ How sin entred, and death by sin into
the world, and now man dead while
he lives, and all is dead works that
man brings forth, wherein the state of
all the Sons of men may be seen, and
their works in the fall.

    _ Self righteousness, deeds of darkness
also, and dead works which though
they be not counted as bad as the
former, by them that act in them,
yet they are to be condemned also;
And man who acts them being in the
fall.

    _ How all men upon the earth, in the degeneration,
and in the fall, and in the
transgression, have corrupted themselves,
and have been idolaters in
every administration; (being gone
from the power) in which man had
the ability, power, and wisdom to worship
God aright, and honour the living
God of heaven and earth.

    _ How the woman that was cloathed with
the Sun, and had the Crowne of twelve
Stars upon her head, which did flie
into the wildernesse, comes out againe
after the great whore is judged, and
her child that was caught up unto God,
comes to appeare again.

    _ The day of the Lord and how it is seen.

    _ The day of the Lord, what it is, and to
whom it hath appeared, discovered, and
how it is seen.

    _ What the day of the Lord is, and what
it will be to the wicked, delcared.

    _ What the day of the Lord is to the righteous,
and how he appeares to them,
and whether any are to looke for it
while in the body, resolved.

    _ Where the day of the Lord doth appear•
and how it cometh, and how it is to be
looked for, declared.

    _ What the spirit of the Lord is, and how
it comes to be received, which discovers
the things of God.

    _ How the spirit of truth worketh and operateth
in them who are convinced, and
yet hath not obeyed it, shewed.

    _ How the spirit of the Father worketh in,
them who are turned to it, and have
taken heed unto its manifestation, and
are in some measure partakers of its
power.

    _ Vnto whom the Spirit of the Father bears
witness, and seals assurance of the
Fathers love, and of justification with
God, declared.

    _ What the free grace of God is, and unto
whom it hath appeared, and where all
are to wait to receive it, declared, as
it hath been revealed by the Spirit.

    _ Whether all have received the grace of
God or no, declared; and whether it
be a sufficient teacher in it selfe, to wit,
that grace that hath appeared to all,
if it be received, demonstrated.

    _ A word to you wise men of this world, who
are glorying in the sound of words, and
worshipping outward appearances; to
all wise and litter all professors, who
think you are worshipping God aright,
who think to search in to the deep things
of God by your natural wisdom, learning,
and parts and study.

    _ The Kingdom of God, and of his Christ
declared in some measure as it is revealed,
what it is, and where it is to
to be waited for, and how it cometh to
be revealed to them, and in them that
believe; that all who are waiting for
it, may know wherein it consists, and so
receive the end of their hope, and the
end of their expectation, and know the
Dominion which hath no end.
